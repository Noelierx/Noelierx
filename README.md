# Hello world 👋! I'm Noëlie <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/mGcNjsfWAjY5AEZNw6/giphy.gif" alt="" width="50">

👩‍💻 I'm currently Engineering Manager at [Jaji](https://jaji.fr/)! I'm also a [Game'Her](https://gameher.fr/) contributor. I worked at [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/en) as frontend engineer and teacher at [EEMI](https://www.eemi.com/). I also worked as an accessibility consultant. My passion lies in creating inclusive digital experiences and raising awareness about the importance of web accessibility.
I'm also the founder of [Koala](https://meetkoala.netlify.app/en).

📄Alongside this, I'm currently trying to build [WhiskerWatch](https://github.com/Noelierx/WhiskerWatch), a web application designed to provide comprehensive care and medical information for your beloved cat.
